            To test for market spatial segmentation, local and global spatial autocorrelation were calculated. 
            A queen contiguity-based spatial weights was obtained from the geospatial datasets. 
            The degree to which contiguous spatial units reflected similar values, and whether said observed patterns were randomized outcomes were then calculated. 
            This analysis was performed on the Internet Service Providers (ISPs), pricing, and broadband subscription datasets.

            A Bayesian Network was constructed using demographic data such as race, income, age, and broadband subscription rates,
             plus the number of unique broadband ISPs at the Census block level. 
            The network showed which of those factors had an impact on broadband subscription rates.

            Text mining based on Twitter data was also performed to provide more insights into the public's perception of current telecom service. 
            Twitter analysis includes tweet retrieval, text preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, sentiment analysis and word cloud visualization. Tweets mentioning a provider and services between 2010 and 2020 were scraped. 
            A Word2vec-LSTM model evaluated each tweetâ€™s sentiment on a scale of 0 (negative) to 1 (positive).
