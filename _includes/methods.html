            Spatial autocorrelation is the degree to which contiguous spatial units reflect similar values, and whether said observed patterns 
            were randomized outcomes. 
            It involves calculating the correlation between observed values of a variable of interest and the
             spatial lag of that particular variable, multiplied and standardized by a weight assigned to its contiguous neighbors. 
           <br><br>  
           The spatial lag is obtained by averaging all values of contiguous locations. 
           A positive r-squared value between the two indicates that the value of the variable in consideration is auto-correlated with
            that of neighboring locations.

            Spatial regression analysis introduces a spatially-lagged term in a regression model that allows the coefficients to vary by borough,
             while accounting for the cumulative effects of each census tract’s independent variables on the dependent variable,
             the household broadband internet subscription rate.

                A linear regression was utilized to understand the demand and supply relationship in the NYC telecom industry.  
                The model uses data from 2017-2019 of all 2165 NYC census tracts. 
                The dependent variable we're predicting is the price of broadband service (P).
            </p>
            <p>    
                For the demand side, independent variables include: number of ISPs, subscription rate, race, age, and borough.

                For the supply side, the only independent variable is the number of broadband service providers in each Census tract (Q).

                The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) was used to estimate the concentration level of the broadband market in New York City.
                This measure is commonly used by the Department of Justice to determine firm-market concentration and competitiveness.
                <br><br>
                The HHI was calculated by taking the sum of the square of each internet firm’s market share,
                taking into account the relative size distribution of each firm. 
                The number will increase when more companies emerge in a market or the disparity in size between those firms decreases. 
                However, this method fails to assess the complexities of various markets in a more accurate way.

            A Bayesian Network is a probabilistic graphical model that was used to show causation relationships between
             the descriptive data of each Census tract.
            <br><br>
            The data used to construct the net included data such as race, income, age mix, and broadband subscription rates,
             plus the number of unique broadband ISPs at the Census block level.

            Text mining based on Twitter data was performed to provide more insights into the public's perception of current telecom service. 
            Tweet analysis includes: tweet retrieval, text preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, sentiment analysis and word cloud
             visualization. 
            <br>
            Tweets posted between 2010 and 2020 that mentioned a provider and certain service keywords were scraped using a Python package TWINT. 
            A pre-trained Word2vec-LSTM model then evaluated each tweet’s sentiment on a scale of 0 (negative) to 1 (positive).
