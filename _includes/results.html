                                Currently only two thirds of NYC households have access to a wired broadband connection. 
                                We created this dashboard to appreciate in red the Census tracts with broadband internet adoption rates lower than 66% (i.e. two-thirds).
                                <br><br> 
                                Visually we can see that the Bronx as a whole struggles with low adoption rates,
                                whereas the other boroughs have smaller more concentrated hotspots like in Williamsburg, the Lower East Side, and Borough Park. 
                                Additionally, to add more color to this visualization we added information about income rates and the number of unique internet
                                service providers (ISPs) found in eacn tract. 
                                <br><br>
                                As we can discover through the dashboard, areas with the most disparaties in broadband subscription (Wired Broadband < 0.66)
                                come from areas with low income (00-50k > 0.50), while the number of ISPs don't seem to have much of an impact on
                                broadband adoption rates.

                            Our regression identified a significant negative correlation in the demand side,
                             and a significant positive correlation in the supply side. 
                            These result agree with microeconomic theory that states that higher prices for a good leads to
                             fewer people consuming the same good.
                            <br><br>
                            Furthermore the results showed that race and borough were factors of significant influence on the price
                             of broadband internet. 
                            The results also pointed that broadband service cost more in communities with more people of two or more
                             races, or those located in Staten Island.

                            Finally, by combining the demand and supply curves calculated using the regression results,

                            In NYC the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index score for the telecoms industry is of 3,096.

                                Sentiment analysis (as pictured below) determined that more than half of all the collected tweets were negative (e.g. complaints). 
                                This indicates that in most cases users tweet about their ISP when there is a problem with their service.

                                On a provider level across time, tweet sentiment grew positive (towards value of 1) between 2013 and 2018, and then decreased between 2018 and 2020. 
                                This indicates that between 2015 and 2018, consumers may have been more satisfied with their service, as they tweeted less about it.

                                Considering the tweets which display extremely negative sentiment, the word cloud below shows what words are
                                 commonly used in these tweets.

                                Mobile service is the most commonly mentioned kerword/phrase in negative tweets. 
                                Some of the other significant keywords (e.g. internet, data, wifi, cable, network, speed, 3g, signal, LTE, slow) show that most people
                                 complained about the performance aspect of their internet service (connectivity, accessibility, speed). 
                                This could be a symptom of the oligopolistic market, where companies do not have enough incentive to maintain high internet service quality.

                                These result suggests that government agencies and public policy should not only focus on the quantity of providers
                                 in NYC but also on how to address service quality.
