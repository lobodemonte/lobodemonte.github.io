                        Currently only two thirds of NYC households have access to a wired broadband connection. 
                        We created this dashboard to appreciate in red the Census tracts with broadband internet adoption rates lower than 66% (i.e. two-thirds).
                        <br><br> 
                        Visually we can see that the Bronx as a whole struggles with low adoption rates,
                         whereas the other boroughs have smaller more concentrated hotspots like in Williamsburg, the Lower East Side, and Borough Park. 
                        Additionally, to add more color to this visualization we added information about income rates and the number of unique internet
                         service providers (ISPs) found in eacn tract. 
                        <br><br>
                        As we can discover through the dashboard, areas with the most disparaties in broadband subscription (Wired Broadband < 0.66)
                         come from areas with low income (00-50k > 0.50), while the number of ISPs don't seem to have much of an impact on
                         broadband adoption rates.

                            In both 2017 and 2019 results, a significant negative correlation was identified in the demand side while a
                             significant positive correlation was identified in the supply side. The result accords with the microeconomic
                             theory that the higher the price of broadband service, the fewer quantity people are willing to or able to
                              afford while the more providers will be since the market is promising. 
                            Besides, people in one certain tract that earn more income may be able to afford more expensive broadband services,
                             which drags up the price. Race and borough are also found to have varying influence on the price. 
                            Broadband service charges more in a community where two or more races live and in Staten Island. 
                            Potential reasons may have a relationship with the shortage of broadband infrastructure in those areas.
                            For the demand and supply analysis, the cross point of the demand curve and supply curve is considered as
                             the market equilibrium. Given the latest datasets, the equilibrium indicates the optimal number of providers are near 5, which means it would be better for both customers to have choice and providers to gain more market share. The equilibrium price is approximately 70.9 per line per month. Compared with the market 2 years ago, the latest demand curve moves slightly upward, which may result from a potential budget increase in the broadband service. People are willing to pay more for internet access. The supply curve moves downward, which indicates new tech such as 5G may drag down the cost so competition between companies increases and price decreases.
