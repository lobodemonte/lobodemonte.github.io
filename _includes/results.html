                                Currently only two thirds of NYC households have access to a wired broadband connection. 
                                We created this dashboard to appreciate in red the Census tracts with broadband internet adoption rates lower than 66% (i.e. two-thirds).

                                Visually we can see that the Bronx as a whole struggles with low adoption rates,
                                whereas the other boroughs have smaller more concentrated hotspots like in Williamsburg, the Lower East Side, and Borough Park. 
                                Additionally, to add more color to this visualization, it includes information about income rates and the number of unique internet
                                service providers (ISPs) found in eacn Census tract.

                                As we can discover through the dashboard, areas with the most disparaties in broadband subscription (Wired Broadband < 0.66)
                                come from areas with low income (00-50k > 0.50), while the number of ISPs don't seem to have much of an impact on
                                broadband adoption rates.

                                At the scale of census tracts, internet service infrastructure displays strong signs of spatial autocorrelation. 
                                There are clusters of spatially contiguous census tracts that share similar levels of infrastructural provision
                                in terms of price and the number of ISPs that is beyond randomness.

                            Much like the Pricing Regression results of the supply and demand of ISPs, the Spatial Regressions showed that
                             income levels were significant variables in determining broadband subscription rartes. 
                            <br><br>
                            Census tracts with more wealthier residents are associated with higher subscription rates. 
                            More interestingly, the number of ISPs was negatively correlated with subscription rates. 
                            These findings might imply that in the long-run, an increase in the number of ISPs can result in market
                             fragmentation that reduces subscription rates.

                            These result agree with microeconomic theory that states that higher prices for a good leads to
                             fewer people consuming it.

                            Furthermore the results showed that race and borough were factors of significant influence on the price
                             of broadband internet. 
                            The results also pointed that broadband service cost more in communities with more people of two or more

                                 complained about the performance aspect of their internet service (connectivity, accessibility, speed). 
                                This could be a symptom of the oligopolistic market, where companies do not have enough incentive to maintain high internet service quality.
